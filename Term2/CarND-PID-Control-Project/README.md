There's an experimental patch for windows in this [PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-PID-Control-Project/pull/3)

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

# Reflection
---
### Effect of P, I, D components 
- The **proportional** component "P" is mainly in charge of directly **reducing the cross-track error (CTE)** and steering the vehicle towards the center of the lane. However, this component alone makes the car **oscillate**. 

- The **differential** component "D" helps stabilizing the P controller by taking into account the **derivative** of the error, effectively **reducing the oscillations**. A properly tuned D parameter will cause the car to approach the center line smoothly without ringing.

- The **integral** component (I) helps **reducing constant error** which cannot be removed via the P or D components. This happens especially in **sharp curves**. Without the I component, the vehicle tends to stay on the outer side of the curve, because the P component is not enough to bring the vehicle back to the center - it's already spending effort in keeping the vehicle in the lane. Adding a small integral term, the vehicle turns **and** at the same time goes back to the center of the lane.

###  How the final hyperparameters were chosen.

- I started with the kp = ki = kd = 0.0. 
    Increasing the kp by 0.1 until vehicle was able to follow the curve and start to oscillate. I stopped at 0.2.
    Kd parameter is tuned for the same kp until  was able to "relatively fast"  stop oscillations and take the curve          smoothly. Final kd is 1.5. 
For tweaking the ki parameter I was observing car in the sharp curves. Since this parameter is 
multiplying the integral of the error, which can be a big number. If I is too big, the vehicle will start to oscillate again or go completely off track. Therefor I started with a small number 0.0001.

- The car is still having oscillations and definitely parameters can be improved by additional testing and twiddling but in short period this parameters were able to hold car on the truck.

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
